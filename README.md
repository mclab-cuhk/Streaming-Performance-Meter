Streaming Performance Meter

We have a high resolution bluray movie database of over 700 licensed popular titles.

Each of them are bitrate scanned and data recorded down to video frame level.

This is a project to re-construct a placeholder movie with exactly the same bitrate profile as recorded from any of
the bluray movie titles with barcodes embedded frame information to allow for QoE evaluation during playback

The Streaming Performance Meter part is the video processor to decode the recorded playback of the virtual movie with barcode data of original frame information to yield the statistical data for QOE calculation
