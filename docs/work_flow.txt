The Movie Bitrate ReConstructor is a workflow for generating pseudo movie and investigate different aspects during streaming playback.

In general it includes the following steps:

1. Generate / Encode a pseudo high bit rate bluray movie by the modified encoder, according to bitrate data acquired from real
bluray bitrate traces. This step embeds barcode with per frame information of the original bluray movie into the encoded frames.

2. Set up a desired network environment to stream and playback the pseudo movie on your desired devices, e.g. mobile 3G 4G network
and a suitable mobile handset. During the playback of the movie it may encounter different rebuffering and/or suspension. The
whole playback is filmed unattended by another camera and this recorded movie will be analysed.

3. The captured playback video in step 2 will be passed through the modified decoder to decode the recorded barcodes for data
showing the pseudo movie's actual playback time and frame correlation. This data can be fed into different analysers for calculating
playback statistics like QoE values.
